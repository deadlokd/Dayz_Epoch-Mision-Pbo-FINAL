Dayz_Epoch-Mision-Pbo-FINAL
===========================

Included Daimyos BaseBuilding, Sleep/Heal Tent, AutoRefuel, Ground Bandit/survivors all working with no script errors. BUT.... please read on.

These are the current Problems so far, the entire PBO is currently working without any script errors, but:

Daimyos basebuilding v1.2 - No script errors, but i cant seem to access the interface. the only tool currently
missing is a crowbar.

other than that i have everything else needed to start building:
Example, with 2 pieces of wood pile i should be able to create lumber,correct? 
i can make all the other normal stuff, but no interface is up. only difference i did notice is that
i have to aim alittle higher rather than looking at the floor, when i looked at the floor i tried to
build a wired fence and it killed me. but the fence spwned. somehow the image looked like it came from behind me forward.
and it killed me.. actually knocked me out, but i survived.. lol..

Auto Refuel = WORKS no problem

Sleep/ Heal Tent -  WORKS NO PROBLEM, sound effects included.

Ground AI-  THey just SHOOT EVERYTHING>> BANDIT OR SURVIVOR, they kill us.. so now we just kill them till we can
fix this .. as this is not very good for other players .. LoL... 

i learned how to do this 4 days ago and have made about 50 scripts but not alot of them work.


im really interested in making the basebuilding work, have some convoy going on in trucks and air heli's..
and PLEASE HELP ME get the dogs to work ..

im runing an epoch server on dayz.st..
